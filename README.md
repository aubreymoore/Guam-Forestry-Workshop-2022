# Guam-Forestry-Workshop-2022

Here are 4 presentations I made at a workshop on invasive species for the Guam Department of Agriculture - Forestry Division on June 29 and 30, 2022. Also a couple of extra slides. All are in PDF format.

You can preview each PDF simply by clicking on the file name. At the top of the preview page is a download button in case you want your own copy.

Additional online resources for forestry in Micronesia are available in [this other GitHub repository]().
