# Guam-Forestry-Workshop-2022

Here are 4 presentations I made at a worksop on invasive species for the Guam Department of Agriculture - Forestry Division. Also a couple of extra slides.
All are in PDF format.

You can preview each PDF simply by clicking on the file name. At the top of the preview page is a download button in case you want your own copy.
